1. Introduction and Premise
In the year 2040, helium-3 is an expensive and highly sought-after fuel for nuclear fusion reactors.  It has been deposited in the lunar regolith by billions of years of solar wind, and its relative abundance there has lead to the rise of several massive corporations trying to mine the most and gain the upper hand.  Due to international treaty, no country has claimed territory on the moon, so these corporations have successfully gotten away with many otherwise unlawful activities.  Each has destroyed countless numbers of the others' robotic mining vehicles, with the intent of stealing their helium-3.  Equally powerful, however, none of these corporations have successfully risen above the oligopoly; the battle continues.

2. How to Play
At the start of the game, each player is given five vehicles to command.  A player may select an action for all five of their vehicles in one turn.  Possible actions include moving, using weapons, arming a shield, mining, etc.  A player wins the game by having the most helium-3 when the time limit is reached, or by destroying all of their opponents' vehicles.

2.1 Moving
If a player decides to only move their vehicle, the vehicle is allowed to move up to five squares in any direction.  If they decide to arm a weapon, activate their shield, or mine, the vehicle may move two squares in any direction.  If they decide to fire a weapon or set up a shield deflect, they may not move at all.

2.2 Weapons
There are three types of weapons in Helium-3: missiles, lasers, and a kamikaze.  Missiles and lasers must be armed first, then fired in a later turn.  If the vehicle moves, the weapon must first be disarmed (although disarming and arming in a new location within one turn is allowed).  A vehicle may not have both a weapon armed and a shield activated at the same time.  Missiles, once armed, may attack any one square within their range of seven squares.  Lasers may attack all squares in one direction (north, northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest, west, or northwest), until the laser encounters either the edge of the map or a shielded vehicle.  Lastly is the kamikaze weapon.  Unlike other weapons, a kamikaze does not need to be armed before firing.  When activated, it attacks the launching vehicle and all of its neighbors.  If a kamikaze is activated while the vehicle has a shield deployed, the launching vehicle is not destroyed (but its unshielded neighbors still are).

2.3 Shields
A vehicle may deploy a shield to protect itself from attacks.  If a vehicle moves, mines, or arms a weapon while shielded, the shield will be deactivated.  A vehicle is allowed to disable its shield, move up to two squares, and then reenable its shield.  If a shielded vehicle is hit by any weapon (including its allies' weapons or its own kamikaze), then the shield is deactivated and must be reactivated during the owner's next turn.  If a vehicle is hit by two attacks before its owner can reenable the shield, the first hit will deactivate the shield and the second hit will destroy the vehicle.

2.3.1 Shield deflecting
Once a shield is deployed, the owner may, in a later turn, create a deflect towards a certain direction.  In addition to protecting the vehicle, deflects will redirect laser attacks in the selected direction.  This may be back at the original laser, or in any other direction.  Players may deflect their own laser.

2.4 Mining
To obtain helium-3 (your score), a vehicle must mine.  One turn's mining extracts 100 helium-3 from each of the cells in a 3x3 grid around the vehicle, assuming that at least 100 helium-3 is available in the cell.  A vehicle may not mine and also have a shield deployed or weapon armed in the same turn.  Before mining, a vehicle may move up to 2 squares in a turn.
If a vehicle is destroyed, all of the helium-3 it contained is redeposited in the ground, where it may be mined again by another vehicle.  The owner of the destroyed vehicle loses credit for all the lost helium-3, unless they use another of their vehicles to claim it again.
